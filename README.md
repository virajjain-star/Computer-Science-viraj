# Computer Science Repository

A collection of Java algorithms and computer science implementations for IB Computer Science SL coursework.

## Backend Integration

This project is connected to the **Vibecode Editor** - a fullstack, web-based IDE for development and testing.

### Vibecode Backend

- **Repository**: [Aestheticsuraj234/vibecode-playground](https://github.com/Aestheticsuraj234/vibecode-playground)
- **Description**: Fullstack web-based IDE built with Next.js and Monaco Editor
- **Features**:
  - Real-time code execution using WebContainers
  - AI-powered code suggestions via locally running Ollama models
  - Multi-stack templates (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
  - Integrated terminal
  - Developer-focused UI for seamless coding

### How to Use

1. Code and test Java files locally or in the Vibecode Editor
2. Push to this repository for version control
3. Use Vibecode for real-time execution and debugging

### Projects

- `Main.java` - Main entry point
- `abc.java` - Algorithm implementations
- `binarySearch.java` - Binary search algorithm
- `selectionSort.java` - Selection sort implementation
- Additional utility classes

### IB Computer Science SL

These implementations support the following topics:
- Algorithms and programming
- Data representation
- Computer organization

## 🤖 AI-Powered Code Analysis with Perplexity

### Connect with Perplexity AI

This repository is configured for direct integration with **Perplexity AI**, an advanced reasoning AI that can analyze, optimize, and explain your code.

### How to Use Perplexity for Code Analysis

**Option 1: Ask Directly at Perplexity.ai**
1. Go to [Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai)
2. In the search/chat, mention your repository: `virajjain-star/Computer-Science-viraj`
3. Ask questions like:
   - "Analyze the algorithms in my GitHub repo virajjain-star/Computer-Science-viraj"
   - "What's the time complexity of the selection sort implementation?"
   - "Suggest optimizations for the binary search algorithm"
   - "Explain the code structure for IB Computer Science"

**Option 2: Perplexity Analysis Tasks**
- 📊 **Code Review**: Request comprehensive code quality analysis
- ⚡ **Performance Optimization**: Get Big O complexity analysis and improvement suggestions
- 📚 **Learning**: Ask for step-by-step explanations of algorithms
- 🐛 **Bug Detection**: Identify edge cases and potential issues
- 📖 **Documentation**: Generate documentation and comments

### Example Perplexity Queries

```
"Analyze Main.java from virajjain-star/Computer-Science-viraj and explain the architecture"

"What's the time and space complexity of my selection sort implementation?"

"How would you refactor the binary search algorithm following Java best practices?"

"Is my code IB Computer Science compliant? Any improvements needed?"
```

### Configuration

See `.perplexity.yml` for detailed Perplexity AI integration configuration including:
- Pre-configured analysis queries
- Focus areas (efficiency, readability, optimization)
- Supported file list
- Integration setup

### Integration Benefits

✅ Real-time code analysis and feedback  
✅ Algorithm complexity evaluation  
✅ Performance optimization suggestions  
✅ Best practices recommendations  
✅ Learning and explanation support  
✅ Bug detection and edge case identification
