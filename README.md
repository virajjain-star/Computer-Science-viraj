# Computer Science Repository

A collection of Java algorithms and computer science implementations for IB Computer Science SL coursework.

## Backend Integration

This project is connected to the **Vibecode Editor** - a fullstack, web-based IDE for development and testing.

### Vibecode Backend

- **Repository**: [Aestheticsuraj234/vibecode-playground](https://github.com/Aestheticsuraj234/vibecode-playground)
- **Description**: Fullstack web-based IDE built with Next.js and Monaco Editor
- **Features**:
  - Real-time code execution using WebContainers
  - AI-powered code suggestions via locally running Ollama models
  - Multi-stack templates (Node.js, Python, Java, etc.)
  - Integrated terminal
  - Developer-focused UI for seamless coding

### How to Use

1. Code and test Java files locally or in the Vibecode Editor
2. Push to this repository for version control
3. Use Vibecode for real-time execution and debugging
